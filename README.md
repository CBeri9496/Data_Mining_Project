# CHARACTERIZING VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT

# Overview

+ We acquired an Identity Theft Supplement (ITS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). 
+ From January to June 2012, the ITS collected data from persons who experienced one or more attempted or successful incidents of identity theft during the 12 months preceding their interview. 
+ Approximately 16.6 million persons or 7% of all U.S. residents age 16 or older, were victims of one or more incidents of identity theft on 2012. 
+ Direct and indirect losses from identity theft totaled $24.7 billion in 2012. 
+ Among identity theft victims, existing bank (37%) or credit card accounts (40%) were the most common types of misused information.
+ About 14% of identity theft victims experienced out-of-pocket losses of $1 or more. 
+ Of these victims, about half suffered losses of less than $100. 
+ Over half of identity theft victims who were able to resolve any associated problems did so in a day or less; among victims who had personal information used for fraudulent purposes, 29% spent a month or more resolving problems. 
+ About 36% of identity theft victims reported moderate or severe emotional distress as a result of the incident before, we were interested in two main things: 
+ 1. It focuses on the most recent incident experienced to describe victim characteristics and victim responses to identity theft. 
+ 2. In addition to suffering monetary losses, some identity theft victims experienced other financial and legal problems.


# Data

+ Since this data comes from a survey, there were many records that had “bad” data. 
+ We ended up eliminating some of the data due to missing, invalid or inconsistent occurrences. 
+ This report uses data that differ from previous BJS statistical collections on the topic of identity theft. 
+ A final sample size of 69,814 of the original NCVS-eligible respondents completed the ITS questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 91.9%. 
+ All of the data will be obtained from the bjs and datasets maintained at http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=42
+ All of the data will be in ARFF or CSV or Microsoft Excel format files. 
+ Those will make easy to do analysis on datasets. 
+ WEKA or WEKA with JAVA will be use to do the data analysis. 
+ There we will be going to use K-Mean Cluster and Classification algorithms for research questions. 

# Research Questions
+ Some of the questions we wanted to explore those are: 
+ 1. Are men or women more prone to being victims of identity theft? 
+ 2. Is the economic impact of identity theft is comprised of direct and indirect financial loss? 
+ 3. Does victims suffered with any emotional distress experience while resolving the problem?
