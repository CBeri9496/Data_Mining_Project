# CHARACTERIZING VICTIMS OF IDENTITY THEFT

# Overview

+ We acquired an Identity Theft Survey report from the Federal Trade Commission administered in September 2003 by Synovate Research Company.
+ The data sample included 4,057 observations with 46 variables obtained from four waves of surveys. 
+ Among 4,057 observations, about 700 experienced identity theft (17.25%). 
+ Since 60% of our group members personally experienced identity theft before, we were interested in two main things: 
+ 1. verify our assumptions of what type of individuals are more prone to be identity theft victims, 
+ 2. verify the reported results of the FTC report. 
+ Some of the questions we wanted to explore were: 
+ Are men or women more prone to being victims of identity theft? 
+ Are there differences in victimization depending on where you live: region and urban vs. rural setting? 
+ Does internet use make a difference?

# Data

+ Since this data comes from a survey, there were many records that had “bad” data. 
+ We ended up eliminating about 4% of the data due to missing, invalid or inconsistent occurrences. 
+ As a result, we went from 4,057 records down to 3,887 with 17.59% victims.
